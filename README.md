### Project Description
[A calculator that intentionally reverses your math operations, then flips your answer for extra confusion ‚Äî and only gives the correct answer when you clap for it.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People have it too easy doing math. You press 2 + 3, and it just works. Where‚Äôs the challenge? Where‚Äôs the chaos? Life is boring without a bit of unnecessary frustration.
so human interaction to have some fun.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We introduce the Reverse Clap-Activated Calculator: it swaps your operations (+ becomes -, * becomes /) and then reverses the digits of the answer (18 becomes 81). If you clap, it finally decides to show you the right answer. You get math, mystery, and mild madness ‚Äî all in one gadget.]
